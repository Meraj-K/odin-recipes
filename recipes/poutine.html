        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Poutine is a hearty, comfort food dish that originated in Quebec, Canada, but has since gained popularity across North America. The dish is wonderfully simple yet indulgent, consisting of three main components: crispy French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The fries are deep-fried until golden brown and crispy, then topped with fresh cheese curds—usually white cheddar—that have a mild, tangy flavor and a squeaky texture. Finally, the assembly is smothered in a rich, savory gravy, often made from a blend of beef or chicken stock thickened with a roux of flour and butter.</p>

            <p>This trio of ingredients melds together to create a dish that is salty, creamy, and utterly satisfying. While the classic poutine sticks to the basic trio, there are numerous variations that include additional toppings like pulled pork, sautéed mushrooms, or even foie gras for a gourmet twist. Whether enjoyed as a late-night snack, a fast-food meal, or a side dish, poutine is a beloved Canadian specialty that has won the hearts of food lovers around the world.</p>
