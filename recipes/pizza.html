        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy but has gained global popularity, with countless regional variations and toppings. At its most basic, pizza consists of a flat, round dough base topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and often a variety of other ingredients like vegetables, meats, and herbs. The dough is typically made from a simple mixture of flour, yeast, water, and salt, which is allowed to rise before being rolled or stretched into a thin or thick disk. The dough serves as a canvas for the sauce and toppings, and once assembled, the pizza is baked in a high-temperature oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

            <p>Over the years, pizza has evolved into numerous styles, including Neapolitan, New York, Chicago deep-dish, and Sicilian, to name just a few. The choice of toppings can range from the classic Margherita—tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and basil—to more inventive combinations that may include everything from pineapple and ham to barbecue chicken. Whether enjoyed as a quick slice on the go, a sit-down meal in a pizzeria, or a homemade creation, pizza is a versatile and universally loved dish that brings people together.</p>
