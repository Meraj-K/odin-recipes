        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Filet mignon is a high-quality cut of beef taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin, a muscle that runs along the spine of the cow. This particular muscle does minimal work, making the meat exceptionally tender, lean, and subtly flavored, qualities that contribute to its status as a luxury item on many menus.</p>

            <p>The expense of filet mignon is due to several factors, including the limited quantity of this specific cut available on each cowâ€”usually only about 4 to 6 pounds of usable meat. Additionally, the overall demand for this tender, lean cut remains high, and it often requires more precise butchering skills, all of which contribute to its higher price point.</p>
